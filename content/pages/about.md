Title: about

My name is Idan Kamara (pronounced e-dan), I currently reside in San Francisco.
This is a place for me to put my thoughts into words, which I hope are
sometimes interesting and useful to others.

I am the author of [explainshell.com](http://explainshell.com). I used to
contribute code to Mercurial, an open source source control management tool and
have authored a couple Python libraries.
